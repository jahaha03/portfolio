              <p><strong>Project</strong>: "Bat Invaders"</p>

              <p>The purpose of this project was to create a game or a 
              story in which the user's decisions greatly affects the outcome. We were 
              told to use the MIT Scratch website to create such project. My partner and I
              decided on a "Space Invaders" type game and replaced the villains with
              bats. There are a few bugs but the game runs smoothly. Some of the
              features include: controlled laser fire, flying bats that shoot lighting
              bolts, map selection, and a shield at level 3. A challenge that we faced
              was that we had trouble coming up with ideas to make the game unique.
              We overcame this challenge by piling our ideas together and choosing
              certain ones, which required cooperation. Overall, my partner and I 
              scored decently and I learned how to use blocks to create a functioning 
              game.

              <p><strong>Project</strong>: "Oh My Spikes"</p>
              <p><strong>Course</strong>: CSP (Computer Science Principles)</p>

              <br>
              <p>The purpose of this project was similar to the first project.
              However, instead of a game on a website, our job was to create an
              app that would appeal to a "client." We were told to use the MIT
              App Inventor website to make the app. My partner and I decided on
              adding to the "Oh My Spikes" barebone game. The game runs very
              smoothly with the exception of two bugs. The features include: a
              bird that can fly with a tap, score multiplier, and deadly spikes.
              A challenge that we encountered was using the blocks to perfectly
              recreate the ideas onto the app. Most of the time, the changes
              that we made would not function properly. So, we asked many
              questions and experimented with a lot of the blocks. With a lot of
              time and effort, we were able to include all of our ideas into our
              game. Overall, my partner and I scored well and I learned more
              how the blocks interact with each other to improve the quality of
              a game.
