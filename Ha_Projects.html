                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a game or a story
                in which the user's decisions greatly affect the outcome. My  
                partner and I were told to use the MIT Scratch website to create
                this project. We decided on a "Space Invaders" type game and 
                replaced the villains with bats. There are a few bugs but the 
                game runs smoothly. Some of the features include controlled
                laser fire, flying bats that shoot lightning bolts, map 
                selection, and a shield at level 3. A challenge that we faced 
                was that we had trouble coming up with ideas to make the game 
                unique. We overcame this challenge by piling our ideas together
                and choosing certain ones, which required cooperation. Overall, 
                my partner and I scored decently and I learned how to use blocks
                to create a functioning game.

              <h3>Course: CSP (Computer Science Principles)</h3>

                <p>The purpose of this project was similar to the first project.
                However, instead of a game on a website, our job was to create 
                an app that would appeal to a "client." We were told to use the 
                MIT App Inventor website to make the app. My partner and I 
                decided on adding to the 
                <a class="text-success" href="http://www.imagnity.com/android/oh-my-spikes-create-a-game-from-scratch-using-app-inventor/" target="_blank">"Oh My Spikes"</a>
                barebone game. The game runs very smoothly with the exception of
                two bugs. The features include a bird that can fly with a tap, 
                score multiplier, and deadly spikes. A challenge that we 
                encountered was using the blocks to perfectly recreate the ideas
                onto the app. Most of the time, the changes that we made would 
                not function properly. So, we asked many questions and 
                experimented with a lot of the blocks. With a lot of time and 
                effort, we were able to include all of our ideas into our game. 
                Overall, my partner and I scored well and I learned more how the
                blocks interact with each other to improve the quality of a game.

                <h3>Course: CSP (Computer Science Principles)</h3>

                  <p>The purpose of this project was to use the Python programming
                  language and its modules to modify an image, so it appeals to 
                  someone trying to sell a product. My partner and I decided to 
                  modify an image of a gaming keyboard to be sold by a gaming
                  company. We changed the transparency and color of the image
                  background, added a border that fades, and pasted a new logo
                  onto the keyboard. A challenge that we had was efficiently
                  using Python and its modules to change the image, since we were
                  both new to image manipulation. To overcome this challenge, my
                  partner and I did an extensive amount of research and
                  experimented with lots of code, familiarizing ourselves with it.
                  Overall, we scored decently and I learned about how Python and
                  its modules work with images to manipulate them.
