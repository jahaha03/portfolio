                <p>&nbsp &nbsp As a high school freshman, I am unsure of my 
                exact career choice. However, I am quite interested in
                being a plastic surgeon because it will be a true test of my
                resolve and overall, it seems inticing. I wish to help people
                with low self esteem. In order to achieve this goal, I have
                to put in continuous effort in my studies of biology.
                Biology is not my strongest point, so I must study more to excel
                in it. 
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp Although the road to being a plastic surgeon will
                be filled with hardships and feel endless, I have no worries,
                for I am self-motivated and I know I can fulfill my goal.
                With the use of this self-motivation, I was able to receive the
                honor roll every consecutive year of school. Additionally, I
                was able to win first place in a Math Counts competition. 
                Because of my abundant diligence, those close to me fully 
                support my goal and believe that I am certainly able to be a
                plastic surgeon. 
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp I know I am prepared for the challenges that lie
                ahead. From doing taekwondo, I learned to always persevere,
                because my ambitions are always reachable, no matter what I
                think. Being in a Math Counts team has taught me to cooperate,
                because not everything in life is independent. Sometimes, one
                must rely on his/her friends and colleagues in order to win a 
                contest or to get a raise. These experiences have taught me many
                things to be a better person, and they will definitely come in 
                handy when looking out to the future.
